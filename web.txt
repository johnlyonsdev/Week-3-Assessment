How does the internet work?
    - The internet is composed of a large series of networks. These networks are
    composed of a series of smaller networks. The internet works by these networks
    sending and receiving information from one another. This allows them to connect
    with each other and communicate packets back and forth. You can find specific
    computers that you wish to communicate with using their IP address.
What happens when you click a link?
    - When you click a link, your browser makes a request to the server that that 
    webpage is linked to. It identifies the server the webpage is linked to through
    translating its domain name to it's unique IP address. If your browser or router don't
    have the translated IP address saved in their local cache, your browser automatically
    gets the translated address from the DNS. After the IP address you're making a request
    from receives your request, it then runs whatever tasks it needs to do to prepare
    the response you're requesting. Once this backend work is done, it responds back to you
    with the neccesary HTML code for your browser to load the page. Once your browser loads the
    HTML code for the page, you'll see the requested browser on your computer screen!
